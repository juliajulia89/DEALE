# DEALE BEER CHALLENGE

Deale is organizing the next team building. The idea is to celebrate a Beer party together, but some team members don't know anything about beer so the team requires a web application to learn some beer characteristics.
The application should consist of two views. The first view should list the beers and the second view should show the details of a selected beer.
The application should be a Single Page Application so that the navigation is done always client-side, without completely refreshing the whole document.

## Specifications
1. Retrieve data from PUNK API: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
It is provided as a static json.
- Get beer list from the URL: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers.
- To get a specified beer details by id:
https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers?ids={id}
- Feel free to choose the beer data parameters to display.
2. Use the framework you feel more comfortable using (Angular is a bonus!).
3. Use of JS third party libraries is allowed.
4. The design is up to you so be creative!
5. Make visible the use of HTML & CSS (or any other CSS processor).
6. Using github would be great if we can see incremental steps.
